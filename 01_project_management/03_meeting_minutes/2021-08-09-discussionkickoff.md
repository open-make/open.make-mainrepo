## What is a kickoff meeting

A kick off meeting is a 2-7 hours meeting with all participants of a project.
The main goal is to get together and **discuss objectives** and work to be done during the first half year - first year.
Additional objectives is to capture the **attention of the professors**, involve them in the project and show what work we will do. 

## Content to discuss

- Define goals
- Define challenges
- Discuss solutions
- What each one wants out of the project
- Find competitive interests and discuss them upfront
- Project managment:
    - website
    - ways to work asynchronously/synchronously
    - DMP
    - External partners, and communication channels with them

## How ?

After discussing pros (PI engagement, getting input, ) and cons (fear of looking unprepared, take too much of their time too early for ininteresting questions), and ways to include the professors in the kickoff meeting,
we decided to:

- Make a pre-kickoff meeting (2021-11-03) for one afternoon (12-16h), with only the 3 PhDs/postdocs to prepare the kickoff meeting.
- Make a 3h kickoff meeting with partners and PIs, asking them for their contribution (presenting their use case for instance, to be discussed during the pre-kickoff meeting).

## Other outputs from the discussion

- Importance of Mentoring : 2 months of calculations in the wrong direction ("that is not the way you would build it"), Better output could have been achieved in 3 weeks with early mentoring.
- Working in team: very efficient way to work as some may be more specialised/knowledgable in different fields of hardware production.
- Price: a 16 000 â‚¬ hardware made by a company versus a postdoc working for 2 months (will it be 2 months?)
- Modularisation: term not well defined, make sense for splitting the work in a team, may be not so efficient in not well defined projects.
- It seems a requirement list is useful to understand what has to be done.
- "Longer documentation implies even more questions that a short one": is that true, if yes, should the documentation be better organised ??
